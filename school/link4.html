            <p>Starting a new job can be a scary experience. New employees who wish to succeed in their job should make a good impression by meeting employers' expectations, and it is essential to show up every day proving what they can deliver for the company. This article will mainly discuss how to succeed in the new job.</p><br>
            <h4>Seek Friends</h4>
            <p>Building friendships with colleagues at a new workplace helps to stay focused and productive throughout the day. It provides a sense of value and belonging at work and increases an ability to remain present. In addition, colleagues at work will be a guide that helps new workers to understand more about the company, such as company culture, vision, and mission. Plus, making a connection with colleagues will help strengthen the team's unity to achieve common goals for the company. </p><br><br>
            <h4>Ask Questions</h4>
            <p>In a new work environment, asking questions when getting an unclear task assigned to you is always a good idea. It is not only to improve understanding of a new task but also a part of social skills to build and maintain a relationship with colleagues at work.</p><br>
            <h4>Be Organized And Develop Good Habits</h4>
            <p>Organizational skills and setting good habits at a new workplace help meet the deadline of given tasks. There are many ways to be organized and develop good habits, such as creating daily, weekly, and monthly to-do lists of important work, and reviewing daily work priorities at the beginning of each day. Do the most challenging work when the energy is at its highest and save less demanding work for other times. Last but not least, always spend at least 15 minutes at the end of each day to clear the desk and 15 minutes the next morning to plan the day's activities.</p><br>
            <h4>Challenge Yourself</h4>
            <p>Regardless of the position, workers should strive to improve their skills and learn more. Try creating a challenge in a new workplace by getting out of the comfort zone, being competitive, and always re-evaluating your own skills and flaws. </p>

            <h4>Build Trust Within Your Team</h4>
            <p>A team without trust is not a team, but rather just a group of strangers who work on the same thing, hence often make frustrating progress. Building trust greatly enhances teamwork to be more productive. Building trusts can come in the form of doing group activities, eating lunch, or working together. When each team member understands one another's personalities and is able to communicate openly, and with an open mind, a  team will be able to operate on its highest efficiency and effectiveness. </p><br><br>
            <h4>Define Roles And Responsibilities For Each Team Member</h4>
            <p>Defining team roles and responsibilities can help a team work together more efficiently towards common goals. Each member needs to know their tasks and responsibilities to meet the expectations and goals of the company. Effective roles assignment can greatly increase efficiency in a team.</p><br>
            <h4>Clear Communication</h4>
            <p>Clear communication decreases the chance of misinterpretation of a message, reduces potential conflicts in a team, and ensures all team members are on the same page and understand each other completely. It also builds trust and improves the overall performance of the team.</p><br>
            <h4>Give Teams Autonomy In Decision-making</h4>
            <p>When team members make decisions, it is essential to show support and trust. A team member granted autonomy can become self-motivated, inspired to achieve, and more committed to the job. Allowing team members to make their own decisions makes them feel more comfortable sharing ideas and communicating openly. </p>

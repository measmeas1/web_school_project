            <p>Building a successful career is a long and arduous journey for most people. Each of these journeys 
                began with an intimidating first step. The first steps, which are the first jobs, are frequently 
                the most perplexing, but they are also the ones that will teach you the most. Your first job is also 
                one of the most important jobs in your life since it will most likely shape your work styles and mindset. 
                Therefore, choosing a suitable first job is extremely crucial for your career overall. Depending on your 
                specialized fields, these 4 jobs that we are going to discuss may be the very best ones to start with in 
                Cambodia.</p><br><br>
            <h4>Graphic Designer</h4>
            <p>Graphic Designers are storytellers whose job is to find ways to creatively interact with both clients and 
                audiences via visuals. Being a graphic designer, you will constantly need to learn to adapt to trends, 
                maintain a creative mindset, work in a team, and last but not least, listen to and execute instructions 
                from supervisors or clients. All of these will teach you important hard and soft skills such as teamwork, 
                data research and analysis, creative and critical thinking and most importantly, communications. You will 
                also find yourself surrounded by or working with creative people who are working toward the same goals, as 
                well as influential people from the same field, which is a great opportunity for you to create networks and 
                connections. For those who are looking into creative, media, marketing, or entertaining fields, the graphic 
                designer position is the best first step. </p><br><br>
            <h4>Web Designer</h4>
            <p>As opposed to the popular belief that the Web Designer is a lonesome position, they in fact, work as a group most 
                of the time. Web Designers are a group of people who creatively use their software programming and engineering 
                skills to design, build, maintain, and improve a website. This position requires extreme attention to details, 
                creativity, and most importantly various computer technical and programming skills, which makes it specifically 
                a position for those who are planning to specialize in the IT field. While working as a web designer, you are 
                given the time and platform to test out and experiment your technical theories, as well as an opportunity to learn 
                from other more experienced co-workers. With the above-mentioned upsides, the Web Designer Position is one of the
                best first jobs for those who are looking to get into the IT field. </p><br><br>

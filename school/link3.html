            <p>Employees are the engines that keep a company running. In every business, large and small, the most important key to success is to keep employees motivated toward reaching their goal. When an employee is motivated and happy, they are often more creative, productive, hard-working, less likely to procrastinate, or worse, resign. While the importance of keeping employees motivated is universally known, the methods of doing so and their effectiveness can vary from employers to employers. In this article, we will discuss 3 of the most simple and effective methods to keep employees motivated.</p><br>
            <h4>1. Positive Interactions/Communication</h4>
            <p>Not every interaction and communication at a workplace has to be about work. Humans are social creatures. They find comfort in friendly interactions and communications since it is in their nature to seek one another to form communities. This also applies to in a company. A simple friendly interaction or conversation initiated by an employer to an employee can give them unimaginable comfort, and assure them that their presence is appreciated.</p><br><br>
            <h4>2. Incentive Programs</h4>
            <p>The effectiveness of incentive programs in motivating employees at the workplace is so widely recognized that most companies in the world have already adopted them. The idea behind it is extremely simple, yet efficient and effective; reward people for working hard and producing results, and they will continue to do so. According to the Business Journals, employee incentive programs keep employees motivated, improve teamwork and morale, and attract top talents, which in turn boost company profitability and business values. Incentive programs are the most simple and easiest way to boost employees' motivation at the workplace, which is why every company should adopt them.</p><br>
            <h4>3. Supportive Work Environment</h4>
            <p>Depending on the work, workplaces can get extremely stressful, and employees spend on average 8 waking hours a day at their workplace. It has been shown many times in countless researches that stress kills creativity, motivation, and most importantly productivity. While eliminating stress from workplaces may not be entirely possible, employers can create a supportive work environment which counteracts them. A supportive work environment, as mentioned early can counteract work stress, and at the same time motivate employees. There are many steps in creating a supportive work environment. Cleanliness, and hygienic work premises is the first step. The second step is encouraging open-mindedness, creativity, self-improvement, honesty, transparency, and flexibility at the workplace.</p><br>
